      { title: <h3>Cultural Info </h3>, content: <p>Paul Stark Sr. of Stark Brothers Nursery traveled over 1,000 miles in search of Golden Delicious apples, a journey known as the "Trail of the Golden Delicious Apple." When Paul Stark Sr. sampled the Golden Delicious apples sent to him by Anderson Mullins in 1914, he immediately ventured out to find the apple's mother tree. Paul Stark Sr. had to travel 1,000 miles by railway and 25 miles on horseback through the West Virginia Mountains to get to Anderson Mullin's farm in Odessa of Clay County, West Virginia. When Stark arrived, he knocked on the front door, but no one answered. Stark decided to look around the property and went behind the house in search of the apple tree. He wandered up the hill behind the house and found a small orchard. All the orchard's trees were barren except for one highly productive tree that was producing dark green foliage with plump, golden-yellow fruits. Stark couldn't help himself and began eating one of the apples. The yellow apple was just as flavorful as the sample he had tasted previously, and as he was enjoying the fruit, Anderson Mullings appeared and met him at the tree. Stark identified himself by saying, "That's some apple," and Mullins replied, "Name's Mullins; I sent you some." Stark and Mullins agreed that day for Stark to purchase the tree, and the deed for the 900 sq ft piece of property that Stark bought is still held in the Clay County courthouse. Before Stark left to return home, he constructed a 30 x 30-foot cage around the 900 sq foot piece of property, completely encasing the Golden Delicious tree. The tree was covered in a mixture of wood and woven wire, and an electric alarm was installed to notify Mullins if someone was trying to steal from the tree. Anderson Mullins watched over the mother tree for over thirty years until the tree eventually died in the 1950s. After the tree's passing, a historical marker was placed along the nearby route 1 for apple enthusiasts to visit. Golden Delicious apples were also named the official fruit of West Virginia in 1955</p>},
